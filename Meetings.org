*** DONE City
CLOSED: [2017-09-18 Mon 15:26]
Choice: Bengaluru
- Bengaluru
  - Logically makes sense. Majority of the organizers are based in Bengaluru and most sponsors, and on-the-ground support, too will likely be in Bengaluru
- Pune
  - Too much of Bengaluru for every tech conf
  - Need tech communities to be encouraged/nurtured/grown at other places
  - Bengaluru gets it share of tech stuff, including Clojure (monthly meets)

*** TODO Venue type
- Hotel?
- MLR (speak with Zainab)
- Nimhans Convention Center (via Sandy)

*** TODO Food Arrangements
- Food arrangements are important, and if not part of the deal with the venue, good food should be accessible close-by.

*** TODO AV arrangements
  - MLR provides (From capturing to processing/uploading)
  - AV needs to be fine-tuned beforehand. (Different speakers, devices, preferences)
  - AV cost increases based on stage/backdrop/screen/cameras/people-who-handle
  - Owner: Srihari

*** TODO [0/4] Other points
**** TODO Number of participants
**** TODO Contract
**** TODO Urgency - because of the wedding season coming.
